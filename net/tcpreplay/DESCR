Tcpreplay is a suite of utilities for UNIX operating systems for
editing and replaying network traffic which was previously captured by
tools like tcpdump and Ethereal/Wireshark. It allows you to classify
traffic as client or server, rewrite Layer 2, 3 and 4 packets and
finally replay the traffic back onto the network and through other
devices such as switches, routers, firewalls, NIDS and
IPS's. Tcpreplay supports both single and dual NIC modes for testing
both sniffing and in-line devices.
