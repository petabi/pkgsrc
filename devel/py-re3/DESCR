pyre2 is a Python extension that wraps Google's RE2 regular expression
library. The RE2 engine compiles (strictly) regular expressions to
deterministic finite automata, which guarantees linear-time behavior.

Intended as a drop-in replacement for re. Unicode is supported by
encoding to UTF-8, and bytes strings are treated as UTF-8 when the
UNICODE flag is given. For best performance, work with UTF-8 encoded
bytes strings.
