Active bindings in R are much like properties in other languages: They
look like a variable, but querying or setting the value triggers a
function call. They can be created in R via makeActiveBinding(), but
with this API the function used to compute or change the value of a
binding cannot take additional arguments. The bindr package faciliates
the creation of active bindings that are linked to a function that
receives the binding name, and an arbitrary number of additional
arguments.
