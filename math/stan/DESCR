Stan is a C++ package providing full Bayesian inference using the
No-U-Turn sampler (NUTS), a variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC),
approximate Bayesian inference using automatic differentiation
variational inference (ADVI), and penalized maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE) using L-BFGS optimization.
