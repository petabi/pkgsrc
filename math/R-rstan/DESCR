User-facing R functions are provided to parse, compile, test,
estimate, and analyze Stan models by accessing the header-only Stan
library provided by the 'StanHeaders' package. The Stan project
develops a probabilistic programming language that implements full
Bayesian statistical inference via Markov Chain Monte Carlo, rough
Bayesian inference via 'variational' approximation, and (optionally
penalized) maximum likelihood estimation via optimization. In all
three cases, automatic differentiation is used to quickly and
accurately evaluate gradients without burdening the user with the need
to derive the partial derivatives.
