The C++ header files of the Stan project are provided by this package,
but it contains no R code, vignettes, or function documentation. The
Stan project develops a probabilistic programming language that
implements full or approximate Bayesian statistical inference via
Markov Chain Monte Carlo or 'variational' methods and implements
(optionally penalized) maximum likelihood estimation via
optimization. The Stan library includes an advanced automatic
differentiation scheme, 'templated' statistical and linear algebra
functions that can handle the automatically 'differentiable' scalar
types (and doubles, 'ints', etc.), and a parser for the Stan
language. The 'rstan' package provides user-facing R functions to
parse, compile, test, estimate, and analyze Stan models.
